# bubbling(up) - a action occurs in a event, which leds chained-call will be reach out to upper element parent element in the DOM tree.

# capturing aka trickling(down) - for the same action as like in the bubbling, which leds chained-call, but, here it'll be top most parent element in the DOM tree to the where the action has been made!
